## Purpose
The purpose of this research is to ensure that people in the industry will actually use our product. During our user profile study, we bundled up all our users' pains and created a solution that could account for them. This research ensures that our prototype does in fact fit to their standards.The user profile reserach can be found in the appendix.

## User Research
During our user research we asked our users to perform these specific tasks regarding our figma prototype:

Rob Moss' account was recently detected as a threat and had his account frozen, can you give me some insight as to what might have led to Rob being flagged as a threat?
Locate list of all contained threats.
Locate the key metrics then identify the total number of insider threats occurred and the number of contained threats.
Who was flagged as a threat just before Rob Moss?

The reason we chose these specific tasks is to allow the user to navigate throughout various important features that our prototype will provide. These include: displaying key insider threat metrics, navigation, user and user event timelines, as well as displaying flagged users.

After performing the tasks, we then asked the users to fill out a survey (https://forms.gle/deeQj9E3tfbP1JBy8) based on their user experience for our prototype. In this survey we asked them questions regarding improvement, aesthetics, troubles, as well as specific questions that we had. After they completed the survey we discussed any questions or comments they had regarding the prototype. This allowed the users to process their thoughts during the survey and then talk to us about their overall experience.

Throughout this process, we also asked users to share their screen so that we can watch them as they perform their tasks and take notes if needed. 

The video/survey interviews and raw notes can be found in the appendix for each user.
