Tweaky on ipad


Task 1:
Rob moss account was recently detected as a threat and had his account frozen, 
can you give me some insight as to what might have lead to Rob being flagged as a threat?

- looking on the the main dashboard
	- wouldve clicked on live threats
	- not the hamburger
- grid /calendar
- first looked at threats pages
	- requesting sort by user option
	

Task 2:
Locate list of all contained threats.
	-click on contained threats


Task 3:
Locate the key metric's then identify the total number of insider threats occurred and the number of contained threats.
	- easily found on dashboard threats


Task 4:
Who was flagged as a threat just before Rob Moss?
	- easily found at threats




####################### GENERAL NOTES ####################### 

rename user page
	- is that all the users?
	- consider scaling, how would the users page holdup
	
potentially merge threats and user page

tweak navigation to make it easier

he likes our UX design, just wants to see better navigation

wants tiered alerts on dashboard

wants timeline on a timed based (per day/week/month) as per users choice

dashboard insider threats is not clear

mttd,mttc,mttr, etc might not be useful on the dashboard but still very important
	-maybe add an infomodal for definitions of acronyms
