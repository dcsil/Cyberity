# Our Team's Exploration on Diversity and Inclusion

### Identify where your team's backgrounds and expertise may benefit the project.

All of our members have a strong intellectual background, with our team members having or working towards university degrees including pharmaceutical science, engineering, computer science and business. This will benefit the team as we each have our own differentiating knowledge base that we bring to the team. 

Dipanker brings excellent business management skills through his time at Rotman. Mina brings his own business experience running his multiple pharmacies. Mina’s experience running and managing multiple businesses will definitely help us save time learning how to do so and save us time and resources. Mark and Vinay both bring strong software development and self learning skills, which are both indispensable skills required for the software development of our startups solution. 

As a side note on unconscious bias, We think it's possible there is a slight case of the halo effect or attribution bias, attributing a strong intellectual background with a university degree. However our team still believes its an important and useful life skill having gone through a university experience. To move past our bias, our team aims to also take into consideration the experiences, personalities, perspectives of the individuals in addition to their skills.

### Identify where your team's backgrounds and expertise are not enough for this project

We are looking to target the finance industry, so I think it would have been useful to have someone with a deeper background working within the finance industry, which our direct team is lacking (however we have great mentors with that background). As Mark and Vinay are still very young in their careers, they have never experienced taking on and leading a large scale software project, which is not a necessity to be successful however it would be nice to have that expertise. We have some AI/ML background but don’t think our current knowledge is enough and that we will have to do a lot more research on advanced ML models. 

### Identify some subject matter experts you think would help fill this gap. Describe how.

With our limited finance knowledge I think being able to consult with someone working close to bank security, such as a bank security engineer or bank manager we would be able to learn a lot more about that space.They would be able to tell us more about typical and atypical bank behaviour, fact or details about security or any problems they have that could help us create a better solution. 

Another subject matter expert we think would be beneficial consulting with is a software project team lead. This would be someone with experience leading a development team and being able to plan for the future, without short term success blocking their vision. We think this is something really hard, as with limited resources you really need good decision making skills such as knowing where to spend funds, when it's ok to implement a work around vs a full solution to bugs, or choosing the best technology to use. 
	
Finally, the last subject matter expert we believe would help us would be someone with both a theoretical and practical background working with advanced machine learning methods. We have some experience with intro to machine learning however the concept of ML can sometimes be like a blackbox where you really have no idea why its works or what approach would be a good one. Having someone with this experience and might be able to guide us in the right direction would be a great tool. 

### Identify where your team lacks diversity

Our team consists of all male members who do not have disabilities, have similar personalities and are not involved in the LGBTQ community. Our team lacks a diverse workforce in gender, sexual orientation, personality and thought-style, and people with disabilities.
 
### Describe how the lack of diversity in certain areas could affect the company, such as cultural blindspots.
 
Our team has two computer science students from the University of Toronto who have gone through the same syllabus and courses, and therefore have a similar thought-style when it comes to approaching a problem. By not having different thought-styles and perspectives, there would be a decrease in creativity and productivity as ideas and solutions would be very similar. It would be a crime if the company only accepted people with similar thought processes and backgrounds as there would be an increase in similarity bias, where there would be a tendency to consider individuals who are similar to yourself as better. A company that takes into consideration diverse individuals would eradicate similarity bias as the company grows.
 
The company could potentially create inappropriate deliverables that do not account for everyone. This takes into consideration the cultural blindspots that the team will be experiencing. If a company lacks people with disabilities, it could potentially create a product that does not account for people with disabilities. An example would be color blind individuals who have trouble differentiating aspects of the user interface of the product. Adding to this, there could also be ineffective marketing that does not include everyone.
 
Limited perspectives due to the lack of gender diversity or the LGBTQ community could lead to policies that are unfairly put in place and do not account for them. This could lead to an unfair and discriminatory work environment. Therefore, having these diverse individuals could make the work environment inclusive and safe for newer employees and members. This could also apply to the lack of diversity in general, as a company could fail to create policies for religious groups such as holidays or accessibility for employees with disabilities. 
 
In general, lacking diversity limits the perspectives of companies when considering developing products. strategies, or internal policies.
 
### Describe how people in other diverse groups benefit your team's vision
 
Our vision is to protect people's livelihoods and privacy from inside the organization. Having a diverse group would greatly benefit our team's vision as it will allow people with different characteristics and backgrounds to use their variety of skills and experiences to help solve the problems at hand. There would also be an increase in creativity and innovation as people with different backgrounds and experiences have different perspectives which can lead to fresh, new ideas and solutions. 
 
Having a more diverse team also means we could tailor our product to include people with more characteristics. Our solution includes analyzing user behaviors, therefore we could come up with a solution that better identifies the various behaviors of a user. An example would be to properly implement a machine learning algorithm that takes into account the behaviors of users with different backgrounds, ages, cultural backgrounds, experiences, etc.
