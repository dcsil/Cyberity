## About Mark
I'm a fourth-year computer science student at the University of Toronto with an interest in machine learning and computer vision.

Having grown up in the family business culture, I'm familar with some aspects of business and am looking forward to expanding into business venture. Some things I enjoy in my free time include bachata social dancing, spending time with my dog, baking, and taking on renovation and landscaping projects.
