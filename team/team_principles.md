#### **Communication**:

- Main method of day to day communication is through Slack.
- Video calls and meetings will primarily be held through Zoom.
- We expect all team members to check the slack group chat at least once per day.
- We expect regular input and feedback from all members.
- All members are open and honest with one another

#### **Meetings**:

- We plan to hold a weekly meeting every Friday at 6 PM. 
- We plan to have a dynamically scheduled meeting for each assignment to go through it together as a team.
- If a team member is unable to make it to a meeting, they will notify in advance or try to reschedule the meeting to an appropriate time. Otherwise they will follow up through slack.
- Other meetings regarding topics not listed above must be notified at least a week in advance as to not cause schedule conflicts.

#### **Work**:

- All team members are expected to complete their portion of work to a reasonable amount. Meaning that each member will be committed to an even share of the work.
- We aim to have all individual work components completed at least 1 day prior to deadlines, giving the team enough time to combine and finalize assignments.
- Team members are expected to complete their work in the time provided as to not create last minute submissions. This can create last minute issues that will become hard to solve.
- Team members are willing to help a struggling team member for the success of the team.
- If something comes up and the team member is absolutely unable to finish their work, they will notify their team for help. The remaining work will be distributed among the rest of the team members.
- Enjoy the process of creating a startup!

#### **Other issues**:

- Newer issues that arise will be discussed among teammates during our meetings.
